# My first react-native project as a Todo App

## Run
* npm ci
* npm run web

## Plans
* Build the most basic Todo App using core components
* Replace core components by more-beautiful components
* Use Redux to manage states https://medium.com/@unionproject88/react-native-todo-app-with-redux-1a612266151b
* Add a second tab
* The second tab is to display all data (from device storage) of the app
* Send data to firebase storage or google cloud
* Authentication ?
