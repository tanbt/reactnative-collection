# My first react-native project as a Todo App

## Run
* npm ci
* npm run web
Can be access by a smartphone with Expo Client app when using the same internet connection.

## Plans
* Build the most basic Todo App using core components
* Replace core components by more-beautiful components
* Split Header component with dynamic property
* Add a second tab (screen) using react-navigation, add icon (e.g. avatar) to react-navigation header
    * Create bottom tab navigation (following starter project)
    * Create header button https://reactnavigation.org/docs/header-buttons
* Use Redux to manage states

* Send data to firebase storage or google cloud
* Authentication ?
* Lazy-loading list
